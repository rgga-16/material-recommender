Summary of the Paper:
The research paper introduces a co-creative system that combines generative AI (specifically DALLE-2 and ChatGPT) to assist interior designers in selecting suitable materials for texturing 3D scenes. The paper outlines a formative study with ten designers and the development of a prototype system with three primary functions: Material Generator, Suggestion Chatbot, and Feedback Module. The system was then evaluated through two user studies assessing usability, task load, creativity support, and systems effectiveness. Participants reported the system as beneficial for exploring material options and providing context-aware suggestions, but they encountered challenges such as input difficulty, issues with visually imprecise suggestions, slowness, and perceived limitations in the AI-generated feedback.

Strengths of the Research Paper:
- The paper targets a well-defined and relevant problem space within interior design and proposes a novel co-creative system integrating advanced AI technologies to address this issue.
- The formative interview study and prototype development demonstrate a solid iterative design process grounded in actual designer needs.
- Comprehensive evaluation through two user studies with different participant groups provides a variety of insights into system usability, effectiveness, and areas for improvement.
- The use of validated instruments such as NASA-TLX, CSI, and SUS adds rigor to the assessment of the system.
- Consideration of a wide range of aspects (durability, sourcing, cost, aesthetics) when choosing materials is a strength that meets the complexity of real-world material selection.

Weaknesses of the Research Paper:
- There is a lack of clarity on methodological details: the analysis method of interview data, control for potential biases in user studies, and the statistical significance of the results.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed system with existing solutions or related work to argue its incremental value and innovation.
- The system’s limitations, such as slow response times and issues with visual precision, could significantly impact its practical adoption, and these concerns need to be addressed more thoroughly.
- The generalizability of the findings might be limited by the sample size and the participant selection methods (convenience sampling).
- There is a need for further discussion on how the system integrates with existing workflows and tools used by interior designers, considering their resistance to trust AI-generated feedback.

Originality:
While the application of generative AI in creative co-design processes is not entirely new, this paper proposes a system that specifically focuses on material and texture map selection in the interior design domain, which has not been extensively explored before.

Significance:
The system addresses a genuine need in interior design and has the potential to streamline the material selection process. However, technological limitations and user trust issues hamper its significance in real-world settings.

Research quality:
The research demonstrates thoroughness in understanding user needs and developing a system based on these insights. Nevertheless, methodological details about data analysis, user study design, and statistical treatment could strengthen the research quality.

Review Summary:
The research paper presents valuable insights into the application of generative AI in interior design. While it demonstrates a well-motivated approach and a clear understanding of the problem, the paper needs to bolster the depth of its methodological explanations and more critically address system limitations and their implications on the practical utility. The strengths of the system’s usability and its ability to provide novel, context-aware material suggestions are notable; however, the issues surrounding trust in AI feedback and technological performance must not be understated.

Recommendation:
RR - I recommend Revise and Resubmit

The paper has potential but requires more thorough analysis and exploration of the issues identified to enhance its credibility and practical relevance. Additional details on methodological rigor and a stronger argument for the system's value within the existing ecosystem of design tools are needed. The issues with perceived limitations and trust in AI feedback, system response times, and technological integration need substantial revision to solidify the contribution of the research.
