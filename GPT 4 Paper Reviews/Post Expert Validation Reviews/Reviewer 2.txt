Summary of the Paper:
The research paper presents PractiMat, a generative AI co-creative system designed to assist interior designers with practical material texturing in 3D scenes. PractiMat leverages DALL-E 2 for generating texture maps and ChatGPT for providing material suggestions and feedback based on aesthetics, durability, sourcing, and cost constraints. The paper includes a formative interview study with designers, the description and technical implementation of PractiMat, and its evaluation through user studies with both design-naive students and professionals. Two studies assess usability, task load, creativity support, and system usability, with findings indicating PractiMat's utility in material exploration, despite challenges with visual precision and trust in AI-generated feedback.

Strengths of the Research Paper:
- The research tackles a relevant and underexplored area within the domain of co-creative design tools, specifically in interior design material selection.
- The integration of formative studies ensures that the system development is grounded in actual designer needs and challenges.
- The user studies are well-structured and involve relevant participants, including both design professionals and students.
- The use of established assessment tools like NASA-TLX, CSI, and SUS lends credibility to the study's findings.
- The discussion and future work sections reflect a critical and thorough understanding of the limitations and possibilities for improvement.

Weaknesses of the Research Paper:
- The reliance on DALLE-2 and ChatGPT might bias the system toward the strengths and weaknesses of these models, potentially overlooking other solutions that could be more effective for certain tasks.
- The user studies might have been constrained by the time limits and the system's slow response times, which may have affected the participants' experiences and feedback.
- The relatively small and geographically localized sample of design professionals from the Philippines might limit the generalizability of the findings.
- The focus on the generative aspects of AI without sufficient consideration for the importance of human feedback and interaction throughout the design process.
- The system's lack of support for adding and adjusting 3D models and lighting settings may limit its applicability in real-world design workflows.

Originality:
The research is original in its aim to integrate generative AI models into a co-creative system to assist with material texturing in interior design. The focus on practicality within the material selection process in 3D scenes is a novel aspect of this work.

Significance:
The paper's contributions are significant in proposing a new tool that addresses a specific challenge in interior design. However, the impact of the research could be improved by addressing the limitations around user interaction and system integration into established workflows.

Research Quality:
The research quality is high, with a robust methodological approach and a clear presentation of results. The thoughtful analysis and critical reflection on the study's findings demonstrate a strong research ethos.

Summary of the Review:
Reviewer 2 appreciates the originality and ambition of the presented work but finds several areas for improvement. The research is well-conducted, and the integration of real-world designer insights is laudable. However, the study's limitations, such as the dependence on DALLE-2 and ChatGPT, issues with system response times, and limited consideration for human-centered design processes, highlight potential areas for fine-tuning. The narrow participant demographic and limited system features also suggest a need for broader testing and enhanced functionality to ensure the tool's relevance in diverse design contexts.

Recommendation:
RR - I recommend Revise and Resubmit

Given the potential of the tool presented and the valuable research conducted, further refinements addressing the identified weaknesses could make the paper a strong candidate for acceptance in subsequent rounds. The paper is encouraged to expand the user studies, integrate additional features for a comprehensive design process, and explore alternative AI models or systems that could complement or replace DALLE-2 and ChatGPT where appropriate.
