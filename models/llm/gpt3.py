Brainstorm prompts that the user can ask you to suggest materials. 
Make sure that these prompts of suggesting materials are based on criteria to suggest materials such as 
price (relatively expensive, relatively low-cost), a specific interior design style (e.g. Scandinavian, Contemporary), 
environmental sustainability, durability, setting (e.g. outdoor, indoor, coastal, tropical), local availability in a certain city, state, or province etc.

I am using DALL-E to create an image texture map of bamboo by typing in a textual description. I intend to use this texture map for a 3D model of a basket.

1) Make a detailed and more accurate image texture map of bamboo material. 
2) The texture map is visually appropriate to use for a 3D model of a basket.
