Yes, you can rotate the orientation of the texture in real-time using the 3D view. Here's how you can do it:

1) Add a variable to store the rotation angle:

```
let textureRotation = 0;
```

2) Update the rotation angle based on user input:
```
function handleTextureRotation(event) {
  textureRotation += event.deltaY * 0.01;
}
```

This code listens for mouse wheel events and updates the textureRotation variable based on the amount of scrolling.

3) Update the texture rotation in the render loop:

```
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  obj.rotation.y += 0.01;
  obj.material.map.rotation = textureRotation;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

This code updates the rotation of the texture based on the textureRotation variable.

With these changes, you should be able to rotate the orientation of the texture in real-time using the 3D view.
