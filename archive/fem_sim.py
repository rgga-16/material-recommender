# Trying out FEM simulation of a 3D model. Code generated using GPT-4.
'''
Creating a full physics simulation algorithm is quite complex and beyond the scope of a simple response. However, I can guide you through the main steps to achieve this goal using Python libraries, such as PyBullet and PyWavefront.

First, you need to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pybullet pywavefront
```

Here is a basic outline of the algorithm you can use to visualize the deformation of a 3D model with a given force:

The simulation in the provided example runs for 10000 time steps, with a time step of 1/240 seconds. To calculate the total simulation time in seconds, you can multiply the number of time steps by the time step duration:

```python
time_steps = 10000
time_step_duration = 1/240
total_simulation_time = time_steps * time_step_duration
```

In this case, the total simulation time would be:

```python
total_simulation_time = 10000 * (1/240) = 41.67 (approximately)
```

So, the simulation takes approximately 41.67 seconds to complete.
