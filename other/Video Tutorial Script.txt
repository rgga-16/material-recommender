Hello. Welcome to this tutorial series. 
This series presents an AI co-creative system that aims to help designers texture 3D scenes
by creating, suggesting, and giving feedback on material textures. 
This tutorial series will teach you how to use the system's functions. 


1) Part 1: Basic Functions (don't show chatgpt) (In Bedroom)
- This video will teach you how to use the basic controls of the co-creative system. Let's look at the middle panel of the screen (highlight center). 
- Here, you can view your 3D scene using the 3D View tab and Rendering view.  
- *Show Image Rendering view tab*. In the Image Rendering, you can view your 3D scene with more realistic quality and with lighting involved. 
- *Show 3D view tab*. In the 3D View tab, you can interact with the 3D objects in your scene. This is where you will do most of your editing.

Here is how you can navigate in the 3D view.
-- Hold right click + drag : rotate view
-- Hold middle mouse click + drag: pan view
-- If you hover a mouse over an object and it turns red, you can select it.
-- If you left click on an object, you can see its details on the right panel called "Object Details".

-- Object Details Tab
-- You can view the object being selected. If you selected a component, you see its name and the object it is a part of.
-- You can view the material, color, and material finish  it is using. You can further edit the name of the material and material finish.
-- Here, I'll show you the several things you can do when adjusting the material of an object.

--- First, the Material Finish tab lets you set different material properties like opacity, roughness, and metalness using the sliders below.
---- Opacity adjusts the object's opacity between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque). This is useful if you are working with materials like glass.
---- Roughness adjusts the object's shine between 0 (glossy) and 1 (matte). This is useful if you want to add gloss to your material. 
---- Metalness can be set between 0 (non-metallic) and 1 (metallic). You set this if you are dealing with materials like steel.
---- Normal Scale can be used to increase the details of the material's surface, making it look more rough. 
---- Height Scale (Buggy. Not sure if to include this)

--- Next, the Texture Map tab allows you to adjust the texture's transformation by sliding the values or entoer your own value.
---- Translation sets the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) placement of the texture map.
---- Rotation rotates the texture map by degrees.
---- Scale sets the sizing of the texture map. 

--- Next, the Color Finish tab lets you add a color to the material by using the color picker or by clicking on a swatch in your palette. 
--- By clicking the dropdown arrow, you can also add new color palettes. 

(Show side table component)
--- Lastly, for object components, the Attached Parts tab informs you on the other components it is attached to and the materials they are made of, for your reference.

-- Multiple selection
-- Multi editing.

-- If you made a mistake when you are editing, you can press the Undo button on the top of the screen. You can hover your mouse over to see the change it will undo.
-- If you want to go back to the change you made, you can press the Redo button. 

-- Rendering, Saving, and Loading Scenes
-- Once you are satisfied with your edits, you can render the 3D scene by clicking on the render button. The newly rendered scene will be shown in the Image Rendering view.
-- After that, you can save your scene by clicking on the Save Scene button. Don't forget to render first before you save!
(*Fade to 2 different scenes)
-- If you want to load a scene that you saved, first select the scene in the Saved Scenes panel, and then click Load Scene.


2) Part 2: Generator Tab
- Hello! In this tutorial, I will show you how to use the Material Generator of the co-creative system. It is located on the left panel of the screen (highlight left panel).
- This module uses a text-to-image generator like StableDiffusion or DALL-E, that can create images from text prompts, and also ChatGPT to assist you in making your prompts. 
- The Material Generator is used to create texture maps from text prompts of materials.
- First, let's say we want to make a texture map of oak wood. First, type in the textbox "oak wood". 
- Next, you can specify the number of texture maps you want to make. It can be from 1 to 20.
- Then, you click "Generate Textures". The time taken to create the textures depends on the number of textures you specified to make. 
- After that, you will see the generated image textures of "oak wood".  

- To apply the texture onto an object, first select the object you want to apply.
- Next, hover over one of the texture maps and you will see an "Apply Texture" button. 
- When you click it, the texture is then applied. 
- You can also apply the texture onto multiple objects by holding shift and selecting the multiple objects, and then clicking "Apply Texture". 
- Then, you can adjust accordingly.
- However, the material generator is not always accurate. (show example of stainless steel). For example, if I type in stainless steel, you would expect a smooth steel texture, but not all of them look like that. This is where you can add keywords to your input.
- For example, if I wanted stainless steel, I would type in words like "smooth" or "shiny". If you can't think of keywords, you can click on the "Brainstorm keywords" button. This uses ChatGPT to brainstorm keywords for you related to your material. 
- Here's another example. You if I wanted wood with a specific grain, I can type in "vertical grain" or "horizontal grain" to get that grain of my wood.


3) Part 3: Suggestions Tab and Feedback Tab
- Hello! This tutorial will show you how to use the ChatBot and Feedback Modules of the co-creative system. 
- Let's start with the ChatBot. The ChatBot module is located on the second tab of the left panel of the screen.
- The ChatBot uses ChatGPT to suggest materials and color palettes for your 3D objects.
- Let's try suggesting materials.
- In the textbox, let's ask for wood materials that are of Scandinavian interior design style and are moderately low cost.
(*type "For the bedframe, can you suggest wood materials that are of Scandinavian style and are moderately low cost?")
- Keep in mind to make your queries specific to get better suggestions from the ChatBot.
- Before proceeding, you can check the "Use Web Search" checkbox and the "Based on the Design Brief" checkbox.
-- The "Use Web Search" checkbox enables the Chatbot to websearch and use references to answer your queries.
-- This is useful if you want it to suggest materials & colors based on current trends like this year's Pantone color.
-- Since ChatGPT only has knowledge until September, 2021.
-- The "Based on the Design Brief" checkbox enables the Chatbot to suggest materials & colors, considering the design brief.
-- The design brief is a specification given to you by the client on how they want their bedroom to be designed.
-- You can view the design brief by clicking on the Design Brief button on the topright corner of the middle panel.
-- Checking the checkbox makes the Chatbot suggests with the brief in mind, making it more context-aware.
-- Let's click on these two checkboxes
-- And then click on the "Suggest Materials" button. 
-- This may take a while, and may take longer if you clicked on either or both of the checkboxes.
-- After suggesting, the Chatbot will return a list of materials, their texture maps, and the explanations why they suggested each material.
-- You can directly apply the suggest material onto the object.
-- But if you want to generate more texture maps of that material, just click "Generate More!".
-- This will lead you back to the Material Generator, where you can apply more texture maps of that material.

-- Let's try suggesting colors, with both checkboxes checked.
-- Again, this may take a while, and may take longer if you clicked on either or both of the checkboxes.
-- The Chatbot will return a list of color palettes, their palette names, and their explanations why.
-- You can save these color palettes, and then use them when applying a color finish. 

-- Lastly, the Feedback Module provides feedback on an object or component based on the material used. 
--- You request for feedback by clicking on the "Request Feedback" button.
--- Similar to the chatbot, can also check the "Based on the Design Brief" checkbox to give feedback based on the design brief.
--- Requesting for feedback may take a while, so please wait. 
--- After, it will provide feedback on several aspects like cost, availability, and sustainability. 
--- In each aspect, it will provide its explanation, and make suggestions on how to improve that aspect.
--- These suggestions can be materials, attachments, and finishes.
--- Similar to the ChatBot, you can directly apply the material onto the object or generate more.
--- With the suggested finish, you can apply those settings to the object's material finish. 

-- In summary, we learned how to use the ChatBot module and the Feedback Module.
--- The ChatBot module can suggest materials and colors based on your queries.
--- The Feedback module gives material-aware feedback on the 3D object or component based on several aspects, and provides suggestions to improve them.
--- Both modules can be used in context with the design brief by clicking on their checkboxes.
--- FIN.
