Based on the content and focus of your research paper, both AVI (Advanced Visual Interfaces) and DIS (Designing Interactive Systems) could be appropriate venues for submission, but there are nuances to consider that may make one more suitable than the other.

AVI is a conference that focuses on the advancement of visual interfaces, interaction techniques, and innovative use of technology in various fields, including design. Your paper's emphasis on a co-creative system that uses generative AI to assist in material selection through visual texturing in 3D scenes aligns well with AVI's interest in visual interfaces and their applications.

DIS, on the other hand, is a conference that explores the design of interactive systems and has a broader scope, including the process, methods, and practices of design. DIS is more concerned with the design implications, theory, and practice of interactive systems. Your paper's focus on the co-creative aspect, the design process, and the usability studies also fits within the scope of DIS.

Considering the details of your paper, here are some points to help you decide:

1. If the primary contribution of your work is the novel visual interface and interaction technique enabled by the integration of DALLE-2 and ChatGPT for material texturing, and the focus is on the visual aspects of HCI, AVI might be the more appropriate conference.

2. If the emphasis of your work is on the design process, the co-creative aspect of human-AI interaction, and the broader implications of integrating AI into design practices, DIS could be a better fit. DIS would be particularly interested in the user studies and the impact of your system on the design workflow.

3. Consider the audience and the type of feedback you are seeking. AVI might provide more feedback on the technical and visual aspects of your system, while DIS might offer insights into the design process, user experience, and theoretical contributions.

4. Look at past proceedings of both conferences to see where similar work has been published. This can give you a sense of which community might be more receptive to your research.

5. Evaluate the acceptance rates and the prestige of each conference in your field. While both are reputable, one might be more competitive or have a higher impact factor, which could influence your decision.

In conclusion, both AVI and DIS could be suitable venues for your paper. However, if the visual interface and interaction technique are the core contributions of your work, AVI might be slightly more aligned with your research. If the design process and the implications of AI in design practices are what you wish to highlight, then DIS could be the better choice. Consider the focus of your contributions, the audience you wish to reach, and the type of feedback you are seeking to make the final decision.

=====
If you were forced to choose one, which would be the most appropriate, based on the current state of the paper's Discussion section?

=====
Given the current state of the paper's Discussion section, which emphasizes the integration of generative AI into the design process, the challenges and implications of AI-assisted material selection, and the broader impact on design practices and workflows, DIS (Designing Interactive Systems) would be the most appropriate conference for submission.

The Discussion section delves into the practical applications of the system, the user experience, the co-creative process, and the qualitative feedback from design professionals. It also addresses the theoretical implications of human-AI collaboration in design, the credibility and trust issues with AI feedback, and the need for context-aware suggestions that consider both textual and visual aspects of the design brief.

DIS is known for its focus on the intersection of design, social science, and HCI, making it a suitable venue for papers that explore the human-centered aspects of interactive systems. Your paper's contribution to understanding how generative AI can be used as a co-creative partner in the design process aligns well with the interests of the DIS community.

In summary, while AVI would appreciate the visual interface aspects of your system, DIS would be more receptive to the comprehensive exploration of the system's impact on design practices, the user experience, and the co-creative process, which are central to your paper's Discussion section.

Thank you. Now, DIS has a recommended word count for papers between 7000 - 8000 words. My paper currently has around 10000 words. 

Suggest edits I can make to shorten the paper to 7000 - 8000 without minimizing its quality. 
=====
To reduce the word count of your paper to fit within the 7000 - 8000 word range for DIS without compromising its quality, consider the following strategies:

1. **Abstract and Introduction:**
   - Tighten the language by removing any redundant phrases or sentences that do not directly contribute to the understanding of the research problem or the paper's contributions.
   - Ensure that each sentence in the abstract and introduction serves a distinct purpose and conveys unique information.

2. **Related Work:**
   - Focus on the most directly relevant literature and summarize broader context more concisely.
   - Combine discussions of similar studies into a single, more efficient paragraph that still captures the essence of the contributions.

3. **Methodology (Formative Interview Study and Co-Design with Professional Designers):**
   - Condense the description of the participant recruitment and interview procedures by focusing on the most critical steps.
   - Summarize the findings from the interviews and co-design sessions more succinctly, ensuring that key insights are retained.

4. **System Description (PractiMat):**
   - Streamline the technical details of the system, focusing on the novel aspects of the implementation.
   - If there are any step-by-step descriptions, consider using bullet points or a table to convey the information more compactly.

5. **Evaluation (User Studies):**
   - Combine similar findings from the two user studies to avoid repetition.
   - Present data in a more condensed form, such as tables or figures, to replace lengthy textual descriptions.

6. **Results:**
   - Focus on the most significant results that directly support your research questions and hypotheses.
   - Use graphs or charts to present data efficiently, allowing you to reduce the accompanying text.

7. **Discussion:**
   - Tighten the discussion by focusing on the most significant implications and recommendations.
   - Remove any speculative or tangential commentary that does not directly contribute to the main narrative of the paper.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Ensure the conclusion is concise and directly reflects the paper's main findings and contributions without introducing new information.

9. **General Editing Tips:**
   - Remove adverbs and adjectives where possible, especially those that do not add substantial meaning.
   - Replace passive voice with active voice to make sentences more concise.
   - Eliminate repetition of ideas across sections.
   - Use abbreviations for terms that are used frequently, provided they are defined at first use.
   - Ensure that each figure and table is necessary and that the text does not repeat information that is already clear from these elements.

10. **Seek Feedback:**
    - Have a colleague or peer review the paper with the specific task of identifying sections that can be condensed without losing critical content.

Remember that while reducing the word count, it is essential to retain the core contributions, the methodological rigor, and the clarity of your arguments. The goal is to make your paper more concise while ensuring that readers can fully understand and appreciate your research.
